This is my CS108 Course Project, In this I've to basically create a simple website where I can search for movies, get their info, rate them, get suggestions based on the rating. For this, I'm supposed to extract the movie data, The code for this is
kept in dataExtraction folder. Then I create a Server to fetch data from the .json file. I've to add customisations like responsive UI, spell correction etc.
